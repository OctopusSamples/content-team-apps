In traditional organizations, developers and those that support them (such as operations or database teams) are often separate entities with little interaction.

This means each team has its own beliefs, responsibilities, and priorities. While not at odds, often those priorities can clash in pursuit of doing best for the business.

Embracing DevOps as a culture means to remove that friction by introducing a shared purpose.

The methods to achieve that can differ and depend how entrenched people are in their ways of working. The aim, however, is to ensure all teams:

- Build trust through clear, honest communication and feedback
- Collaborate throughout the product's entire lifecycle
- Have what they need to make quick decisions
- Can take risks without fear of failure or blame
- Are collectively responsible for the product's success
- Review what worked and what didn't for the next lifecycle
