## Build process

There are two build scripts in the `scripts` directory: `buildk8s.sh` and `build-k8skdp.sh`. Each script has an associated Jekyll config file.

`buildk8s.sh` is used to build the epub distributed though GitHub and Kindle.

`build-k8skdp.sh` is used to build the epub that can be used as the basis for the print book. It resizes the images so they print correctly.
